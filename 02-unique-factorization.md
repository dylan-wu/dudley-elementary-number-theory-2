## Problems

1. Find the prime-power decompositions of 1234, 34650, and 1111111
2. Find the prime-power decompositions of 2345, 45670, and 999999999999. (Note that 101 | 1000001.)
3. Tartaglia (1556) claimed that the sums:
   - 1 + 2 + 4, 1 + 2 + 4 + 8, 1 + 2 + 4 + * + 16,...
   are alternately prime and composite. Show that he was wrong.
4.
   1. DeBouvelles (1509) claimed that one or both of 6n + 1 and 6n - 1 are primes for all n greater than or equal 1. Show that he was wrong.
   2. Show that there are infinitely many n such that both 6n - 1 and 6n + 1 are composite.
5. Prove that if n is square, then each exponent in its prime-power decomposition is even.
6. Prove that if each exponent in the prime-power decomposition of n is even, then n is a square.
7. Find the smallest integer divisible by 2 and 3 which is simultaneously a square and a fifth power.
8. If d | ab, does it follow that d | a or d | b?
9. Is it possible for a prime p to divide both n and n + 1 (n greater than or equal to 1)?
10. Prove that n(n + 1) is never a square for n > 0
11.
   1. Verify that 2^5 * 9^2 = 2592.
   2. Is 2^5 * a^b = 25ab possible for other a, b? (Here 25ab denotes the digits of 2^5 * a^b and not a product.)
12. Let p be the least prime factor of n, Where n is composite. Prove that if p > n1/3, then n/p is prime.
13. True or false? If p and q divide n, and each is greater than n^(1/4), then n/pq is prime.
14. Prove that if n is composite, then 2^(n-1) is composite.
15. Is it true that if 2‚Äù - 1 is composite, then n is composite?
